Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians began returning home to northern Gaza on Monday, bracing for what awaits them in a region that has been reduced to rubble by months of brutal bombardment and fighting.

Israel opened a corridor into the north of the Gaza Strip on Monday, 48 hours later than initially planned. It blamed the delay on Hamas, saying the militant group breached the terms of the ceasefire agreement that guaranteed people would be able to return to the north.

Israel expected Hamas to free Arbel Yehud, a female civilian hostage, in the second round of hostage releases on Saturday. When it didn’t, Israel delayed the opening of the Netzarim corridor that bisects the strip, refusing to let people into northern Gaza. Hamas then agreed to release more hostages, including Yehud, on Thursday and Saturday, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said Sunday.

Israel said Yehud should have been released on Saturday as Hamas is obliged to release civilians first. The four hostages released over the weekend were all female members of the Israeli military.

More than 300,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to the northern Gaza Strip since Israel reopened the corridor, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza.

Seen from above, the crowds on Monday resembled a huge, slow moving wave making its way up Gaza’s coast, then turning inland. Most, including children, injured people and the elderly, were traveling on foot, carrying the little they have left on their backs. Most have spent many months exiled in makeshift refugee camps after Israeli forces ordered large-scale evacuations. They had been praying for this moment for months.

One woman told CNN her son was going to see his home – Gaza City – for the first time.

“He was born in Khan Younis. It’s an indescribable feeling that I am going back to Gaza City. It used to take us 10 minutes to get there, but this time it took a year and a half,” she said, adding that she would “kiss the walls and the ground” upon her return.

“May this be the end of the war, and may the ceasefire last… I gave birth in Khan Younis, and my husband is missing,” she said.

Many people have been waiting for weeks for this moment, spending the past few days sitting out in the streets or on the beach with their mattresses, belongings and water tanks, waiting for the checkpoint to open.

Eyad Al Masri, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, told CNN he was detained by Israel when fleeing the north and spent 75 days in Israeli prisons. He said one of his sons has been killed in the war and another one has been missing since February.

“I have no money or anything,” he said in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, while dismantling the tent his family has been living in. “I’m taking these four bags and going back to my house. I don’t know if it is still standing or not; I am going back to Beit Hanoun.”

Nadia Qassem, from Al-Shati Refugee Camp, told CNN, “we have been waiting for this day for so long.”

“We want to return home… Even though my house is destroyed. I miss my land and my place,” she said.

But the return home will likely be marked by more heartbreak.

“I’m going home, but I wish I weren’t,” Saadiya AbdulAl told CNN while traveling to north with an overflowing donkey cart. “My children are gone, and we are all devastated. None of my family members are left; they all became martyrs in Gaza City. Who do I go back to? I have no house and no one,” she said.

Gaza City, where most of the people making this journey on Monday had been living before the war, is among the most destroyed areas in the strip. There are no fully functioning hospitals or schools in the area and access to water, power and basic supplies is extremely limited, despite aid flows into Gaza increasing since the ceasefire came into effect.

The Israeli military said residents could return on foot along the Al Rasheed coastal road, while vehicle traffic can pass via the inland Salah al-Din road after inspection.

The Al Rasheed coastal road was damaged during the war and remains difficult to pass in some places. At some points, people visibly struggled to get through, with wheelchairs and strollers getting stuck in the deep sand.

Subhiyeh Mohammad was walking bent forward, dragging a small bundle made of a blanket through the dirt behind her. “Our children are gone, our husbands are gone, our homes are destroyed. I can’t carry much; I’m a dialysis patient. I only took what I sleep on,” the elderly woman told CNN.

Armed fighters from the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, were seen among the civilians, wearing their distinct green headbands. Some of those walking past cheered, some posed for photos with the masked fighters.

“We will continue to firmly enforce the ceasefires in the north and south,” Defense Minister Israel Katz wrote in a post on X. “Anyone who violates the rules or threatens (the Israel Defense Forces) will bear the full cost.”

Hamas in a statement praised the return of the displaced as “a victory for our people, and a declaration of the failure and defeat of the occupation and its displacement plans.”

Israel’s far-right former national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who quit in protest over the ceasefire and hostage release deal, claimed the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza was a “total surrender.”

Fragile truce threatened by tensions

Escalated tensions over Yehud’s release had threatened to derail the already fragile truce.

They heightened further on Saturday after President Donald Trump said he had discussed his plan to “clean out” Gaza with the king of Jordan and intended to raise the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

The US president said he would like both Jordan and Egypt – which borders Gaza – to house hundreds of thousands of Palestinians either temporarily or “long term,” telling reporters onboard Air Force One, “because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess.”

“It’s literally a demolition site right now,” Trump said of Gaza. “I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.”

Both Jordan and Egypt rejected Trump’s idea to shift Palestinians out of the enclave, saying such a move would displace Palestinians from their homeland. Trump’s comments were also strongly condemned by Palestinian leaders and human rights groups, who denounced the forced relocation of residents as ethnic cleansing and a possible war crime.

Trump’s comments appear to break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.

Dana Stroul, former assistant deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, told CNN that Trump’s proposal “feeds this narrative” that what Israel and the US really want “is not a Palestinian state living next to Israel, but actually to force them somewhere else.”

Specter of further mass displacement

Trump’s idea to ultimately move Gaza’s residents to another country has only raised fears of further mass displacement among Palestinians.

The Palestinian Presidency said the plan “constitutes a blatant violation of red lines Palestinian leadership have consistently warned about.”

“The Palestinian people will never abandon their lands or their Holy Sites, and will not allow the repetition of the Nakba of 1948 and Naksa 1967,” the presidency said.

The movement of Palestinian refugees out of Gaza would evoke painful memories of the mass displacement that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of the 700,000 people who were expelled or fled their homes during the Nakba, or catastrophe.

Hundreds of thousands more were displaced during the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt.

There are fears that if carried out, Trump’s plan would bring an end to any future prospect of Palestinian-Israeli peace based on a two-state solution.

Hamas in a statement said it will “categorically reject any plans to deport and displace them from their land,” and called on the US administration to “stop these proposals.”

Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad also condemned Trump’s “reprehensible statements” and called the proposal “a continuation of the policy of denying the existence of the Palestinian people, their will and their rights.”

Human rights groups have also denounced the idea.

Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine Director Omar Shakir said in a post on X that it “would amount to an alarming escalation in the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and exponentially increase their suffering.”

US-based advocacy group the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR), said Trump’s idea was “delusional and dangerous nonsense.”"

A freed Israeli hostage says she drew “hope and strength” from other captives while she was being held by Hamas in Gaza.

Naama Levy, 20, who was kidnapped by the Palestinian militant group during the October 7, 2023, attacks, was freed alongside three other female Israeli soldiers on Saturday, as part of a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas.

“After 477 days I am finally home. I am secure and protected, and surrounded by family and friends,” Levy posted on Instagram on Tuesday. Levy, 20, added that she feels “better with each day that passes.”

“I was mostly alone, then I was in captivity with my friends, observers and civilians who gave me hope and strength,” Levy said. “It is important for me to thank the IDF fighters and all the Israeli people. I saw how you were fighting for me when I was captive. Thank you all, I love you.”

Her parents have spoken to CNN several times in the past 15 months urging for her release, including in December, 2023, after she appeared in a cell phone video published by Hamas showing her being dragged by her hair at gunpoint. The footage showed her hands bound, and her pants soaked in blood.

“For her, time is running out,” her mother, Ayelet Levy Shachar, said at the time. She described her daughter as a “very fun-loving girl.”

“When she comes back, she will make the world a better place,” added Levy Shachar.

Next steps in the hostage deal

Levy is one of seven hostages who have been released as part of the first phase of the ceasefire deal agreed by Israel and Hamas.

Her message came as an Israeli official told CNN that the US envoy to the Middle East would meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday to discuss the second phase of the deal.

Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump’s envoy to the region, is also scheduled to meet with Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, the official told CNN.

The current ceasefire deal is set up to progress in three distinct phases. Phase one began on January 19 and is expected to last six weeks. During this time a further 26 hostages – in addition to the seven already released – are expected to be freed, while Israel is to release almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

The second and third phases of the ceasefire are less developed – and the details will be decided during the six weeks of the first phase. Over the past 15 months, Qatar, Egypt and the US have been key mediators in the discussions between Israel and Hamas.

https://www.cnn.com/world,left,https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/29/middleeast/ahmad-al-sharaa-named-syria-transitional-president-intl-latam/index.html,"Syria CNN —

Former al Qaeda member Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, has been named as Syria’s president for a transitional period.

“We announce the appointment of Commander Ahmad al-Sharaa as head of state during the transitional period. He will assume the duties of the president of the Syrian Arab Republic and represent the country in international forums,” commander Hassan Abdel Ghani, spokesman for the Syria Military Operations Command, said in a statement Wednesday.

“The president is authorized to form a temporary legislative council for the transitional phase, which will carry out its duties until a permanent constitution is enacted and put into effect,” Ghani added.

The command also announced several resolutions, including the suspension of the country’s constitution, the dissolution of the country’s parliament, and the dissolution of the former regime’s army and its Baath party.

Al-Sharaa was the leader of the main militant group that spearheaded the lightning offensive that led to the overthrow last year of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, whose regime had been in power for several decades.

His task now will be rebuilding a country torn apart by more than a decade of civil war that has killed more than 300,000 people and displaced millions more, according to the UN. The conflict broke out during the 2011 Arab Spring when the Assad regime suppressed a pro-democracy uprising and soon plunged into a full-scale war that pulled in other regional powers from Saudi Arabia and Iran to the United States and Russia and enabled ISIS to gain a foothold – for a while – in the country.

Shortly before he was named president, Al-Sharaa said the Assad regime had “left behind deep societal, economic, political and other wounds, and fixing them requires great wisdom, hard work and doubled effort.”

A sense of duty was what Syria “needs today more than ever,” he said.

“Just as we were determined in the past to liberate it, our duty now is to be determined to build and develop it,” Al-Sharaa added.

Who is Ahmad al-Sharaa?

Al-Sharaa became a Syrian “foreign fighter” in his early 20s, crossing into Iraq to fight the Americans when they invaded the country in the spring of 2003. That eventually landed him in the notorious US-run Iraqi prison, Camp Bucca, which became a key recruiting ground for terrorist groups, including what would become ISIS.

Freed from Camp Bucca, he crossed back into Syria and started fighting against the Baathist Assad regime, doing so with the backing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who would later become the founder of ISIS.

In Syria, he founded a militant group known as Jabhat al-Nusra (“the Victory Front” in English), which pledged allegiance to al Qaeda, but in 2016, he broke away from the terror group, according to the US Center for Naval Analyses.

Since then – unlike al Qaeda, which promoted a quixotic global holy war – Al-Sharaa’s group, now known by the initials HTS (Hayat Tahrir al-Sham), has undertaken the more prosaic job of trying to govern millions of people in the northwestern Syrian province of Idlib, providing basic services, according to the terrorism scholar Aaron Zelin who has written a book about HTS."

toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

The Smithsonian Institution is closing its diversity office and freezing all federal hiring. The decision will affect dozens of American museums, research centers and libraries, as well as the National Zoo .

""Our Institution is fully committed to excellence in our workforce, free from discrimination and harassment,"" wrote a Smithsonian Institution spokesperson in an email to NPR. ""We are closing our Office of Diversity but retaining our efforts at visitor accessibility as it serves a critical function.""

Sponsor Message

The move to eliminate the Office of Diversity comes in the wake of an executive order from President Trump that describes diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, as ""illegal and immoral."" The Smithsonian is not a federal agency. But much of its billion dollar budget comes from federal appropriations. Two-thirds of its nearly 6,500 employees are federal workers. They will be expected to return to the office in April, according to the Smithsonian spokesperson.

Nearly 17 million people visited Smithsonian museums in Washington D.C., Virginia and New York last year. The most popular include the National Museum of Natural History and National Air and Space Museum on the National Mall in Washington.

Entrance to the museums has been entirely free since the Institution's founding in 1846, with the exception of the Cooper Hewitt, the Smithsonian's design museum in New York. The question of charging for admission has come up repeatedly under various administrations, but rejected, in part, because of concerns about political backlash.

Numerous corporations have eliminated DEI initiatives since the executive order was released. Last week, the National Gallery of Art – which, like the Smithsonian, also receives funding from the federal government – also eliminated its office of belonging and inclusion, as well as mentions of DEI from its website."

toggle caption Pedro Ugarte/AFP via Getty Images

President Trump signed the Laken Riley Act into law on Wednesday, expanding the scope of those who can be arrested, detained and deported by federal immigration officers.

The bill is the first of Trump's second presidency to become law and it comes at a time when he is promising stricter enforcement of immigration laws and increased deterrents to legal migration. It passed with bipartisan support, marking a major shift for Democrats, who did not advance the legislation in the Senate last year.

Trump nodded to that bipartisan support in his afternoon remarks, thanking Democrats for helping to get the measure through.

Sponsor Message

""It's a landmark law that we are doing today, it will save countless innocent American lives,"" Trump said.

In one of her first official appearances, Secretary for Homeland Security Kristi Noem attended the bill signing, as did several Republican senators who championed the measure. Pennsylvania Democrat John Fetterman, who was the first Democrat to cosponsor the bill in the Senate, joined as well.

The law may expand who can be deported but implementation is a challenge

The measure directs federal immigration enforcement to detain and deport those without legal status charged with minor theft or shoplifting, assault of a law enforcement officer or crimes resulting in death or serious bodily injury of another person.

Several criminal offenses could already be grounds for deportation — and indeed Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that those who had broken the law by entering the country illegally had already committed a crime. Critics of the measure argue the act skips the current practice of waiting until someone is convicted before considering the removal process.

The bill is named for a Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. without legal status. Her death became a rallying cry for Republicans who criticized the Biden administration's approach to border security. The man, José Ibarra, was later sentenced to life in prison without parole. He had previously been charged with shoplifting in New York; Republicans argue this law would have enabled his deportation earlier and would have prevented Riley's murder.

Riley's parents and sister were at the White House for the signing. Riley's mother Allyson Phillips spoke briefly, thanking lawmakers and the president for pushing the bill in her daughter's name over the finish line.

Supporters of immigration point to research that shows immigrants commit fewer crimes than those born in the U.S.

Implementing the law may be a challenge for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, one of the agencies responsible for deportations. ICE is also now responsible for newly implemented arrest quotas.

Earlier this month, ICE sent a memo to lawmakers warning that implementation of the bill was ""impossible to execute with existing resources."" In the first year, the agency said, it would cost $26 billion to implement across personnel costs, increase of detention resources, transportation and more.

The agency also warned in a December memo that it would need additional ICE officers and predicted facing barriers with local jurisdictions such as state and local enforcement that might not cooperate. It also made clear that there might be a shortage of detention space to house offenders."

The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady Wednesday as it seeks to curb stubborn inflation.

Fed policymakers have hinted that they'll be cautious about additional rate cuts, so long as the job market remains solid and prices continue to climb.

""We feel like we don't need to be in a hurry to make any adjustments,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell told reporters Wednesday.

Members of the Fed's rate-setting committee voted unanimously to leave their benchmark interest rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. That helps determine the cost of other short-term borrowing, such as car loans and credit card debt.

While the decision to leave rates unchanged was widely expected, it sets up a potential clash with President Trump, who told reporters earlier this month that he believes ""interest rates are far too high.""

In a speech to the World Economic Forum last week, Trump also said he would ""demand"" lower rates.

Powell said he and his colleagues would not be swayed by Trump's demands, but he declined to engage in a war of words with the president.

""I'm not going to have any response or comment whatsoever on what the president said,"" Powell said. ""The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have.""

No rush to cut rates further

The central bank has already cut its benchmark rate by a full percentage point since September. But faced with sticky inflation, policymakers are in no hurry to make additional cuts. Consumer prices in December were up 2.9% from a year ago — a slightly larger annual increase than the previous month.

Meanwhile, the job market has proven to be remarkably resilient, with employers adding more than a quarter-million jobs last month. If the labor market were weaker, there would be more pressure on the Fed to cut borrowing costs and stimulate hiring.

""I have seen nothing in the data or forecasts that suggests the labor market will dramatically weaken over coming months,"" Fed governor Chris Waller said this month.

At their last meeting in December, Fed policymakers projected they would cut interest rates by an average of just half-a-percentage point this year — which was down from the full-point cut they were predicting three months earlier.

There was considerable disagreement within the rate-setting committee, however, with one member projecting no rate cuts in 2025 and others predicting as many as four or five quarter-point reductions.



Uncertainty over Trump's policies

While Trump wants the Fed to lower interest rates, his own policies could work against that by fueling inflation. The president has threatened widespread tariffs, for example, which could lead to higher prices for consumers. Mass deportations could also limit the workforce, making it harder to bring prices under control.

Still, Powell said it's premature to assess the impact of those or other policies from the new administration.

""We don't know what will happen with tariffs, with immigration, with fiscal policy and with regulatory policy,"" Powell said. ""We're going to be watching carefully as we always do."""

If you've listened to any of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s public appearances, you may have noticed a quiver in his voice when he speaks.

That's the result of a rare neurological condition known as spasmodic dysphonia, which has afflicted Kennedy for decades.

""I have a tremble in my voice … particularly when I first start talking,"" Kennedy said in an interview on The Diane Rehm Show in 2004. (Rehm also has spasmodic dysphonia.)

Kennedy said that, earlier in his career, he would receive letters and emails from people who saw him on TV or heard him on the radio, and that three or four of those people suggested he might have spasmodic dysphonia. He later got an official diagnosis.

According to Dysphonia International, spasmodic dysphonia is a neurological disorder that causes involuntary spasms in the muscles that open and close a person's vocal cords, resulting in a ""voice that presents with breaks and strained/strangled quality or breathy quality.""

An estimated 50,000 people in North America are believed to have spasmodic dysphonia, the group says, and it affects more women than men. The cause of the condition is unknown.

An injection of botulinum toxin — or Botox — into a sufferer's vocal chords is one of the most common treatments for the disorder. Kennedy told The Diane Rehm Show in 2005 that he was receiving shots about every four months.

On Wednesday, Kennedy is scheduled to appear before the Senate Finance Committee in the first of two hearings on his nomination to become the new secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

He told the Los Angeles Times in an interview last year that he ""can't stand"" the sound of his voice now and that he feels ""sorry"" for people who hear him speak.

""My voice doesn't really get tired. It just sounds terrible. But the injury is neurological, so actually the more I use the voice the stronger it tends to get."" Kennedy said.

He added: ""If I could sound better, I would."""
