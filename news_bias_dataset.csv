The City of London financial district has approved plans for a 73-floor skyscraper that will match in height Western Europe’s tallest tower a mile to the south, in a sign that city planners are still betting on the office market despite the current downturn.

The proposed 309.6-meter (1,015.75-foot) tower, which will be exactly the same height as London’s Shard, was given the go-ahead after a previously approved plan was revised “to better respond to post-pandemic office needs,” the City of London local authority said on Friday.

Officially called 1 Undershaft, the tower was initially granted approval at a slightly smaller height in 2016 but never started.

The proposed building, which investor Aroland has been trying to get off the ground for years, will require the demolition of an existing smaller tower and has attracted criticism from conservation groups.

Historic England said in a consultation response to City planners in February that the alterations had not altered its impact and said it would “seriously degrade” the public realm around it.

The tower, if built, would provide 154,156 square meters (around 1.66 million square feet) of office space, areas for children’s education on the 72nd and 73rd floors and a publicly accessible garden.

London’s office market has been hit hard by higher borrowing costs and more home working post-pandemic, although premium space has remained in demand.

Very few major London office properties have been sold this year. Investors Nuveen and Brookfield are currently trying to sell London office towers, in a major test for investor appetite.

The supply of new space to let in London has slowed since the pandemic. However, office construction in the City has recently bucked the trend, with new starts up 7% between April and September this year, compared to falls in every other central London market surveyed by Deloitte.

Critics say London’s skyline has become increasingly cluttered by generic glass-and-metal towers that dwarf historic landmarks, especially in the City of London, home to St. Paul’s Cathedral.

“As another, much needed office development gets approved in the City of London, it speaks to the confidence that global investors have in the London real estate market and the UK economy more widely,” said Shravan Joshi, chairman of the City of London Corporation’s Planning and Transportation Committee.

Editor’s Note: This report contains details of death and injury that some may find distressing.

More than 20 Americans are missing in action on the front lines in Ukraine, with a spike in casualties over the past six months as foreigners fill urgent gaps in the country’s embattled defenses, according to a CNN investigation.

The bodies of at least five American volunteers who signed up to the Ukrainian military could not be retrieved from the battlefield after being killed in action in the past six months, CNN found. Two of these were repatriated from Russian-occupied territory on Friday to Ukrainian soil after lengthy negotiations.

The stark testimony of their surviving colleagues, and the growing toll, portrays the obscure yet important role of American frontline fighters in a war President Donald Trump has called “ridiculous” and has pushed Russian President Vladimir Putin to end diplomatically.

The relatives of the missing Americans have told CNN of the distressing lack of closure in not being able to bury their sons, of the legal limbo of not being able to officially declare their loved ones dead, and also of the torment inflicted by Russian internet trolls who harass them online. The intensity of fighting across Ukraine’s front eastern lines means the corpses of soldiers from both sides often cannot be collected and litter the battlefield.

Two American volunteers were killed in a single incident just outside Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine in late September, according to survivors and relatives. Neither’s body has been recovered. Former US soldier Zachary Ford, 25, from Missouri, and another American without military experience, whose family requested to be identified only by his callsign ‘Gunther,’ were killed by a drone while tasked with blowing up a bridge near the village of Novohrodivka.

The surviving American, who asked to be known by his callsign ‘Redneck,’ described a mission with a limited chance of success, where the group of three US volunteers were swiftly trapped by Russian fire in a trench about 500 meters from their bridge target.

“Russian drones start coming down the treeline, to try to crash through the roof of the bunker,” he recalled in an interview with CNN last week from the United States. A log in the roof fell and hit him in the face, he said. “I had the shotgun, I was trying to shoot these things down.”

Ford told his commanders on the radio they would abort the mission but was instructed to continue and that no evacuation was possible for another day, Redneck said. As the assault began, Redneck said he fired his machine gun at Russians directly in front of him, and that Ukrainians manning a grenade launcher and anti-tank Javelin weapon system died while holding back Russian armor.

He said he stepped into a bunker to get ammunition, narrowly missing the drone strike that wounded Ford and Gunther. Ford’s injuries required two tourniquets to stem the bleeding, Redneck said, which he applied before rejoining the defense and seeing a Ukrainian soldier fatally shot in the face in front of him.

Minutes later, he heard Ford yell, “Gunther is dead,” he told CNN. “I came down to check, and the Ukrainian that was in there, and just looked at me and said, ‘friend dead.’” Redneck said Ford remained stable, and their commander warned on the radio that another Russian attack was imminent.

“He knew we weren’t going to make it through another attack,” said Redneck of Ford, “so he started asking me to kill him so he wouldn’t be captured.” Redneck said he refused and told Ford they would find a way through this, before continuing to reload their weapons ahead of the anticipated assault.

“He went really quiet,” said Redneck of Ford. “A couple minutes later, (he) called me over and said he had loosened his tourniquets.” Redneck said he reapplied them, but Ford had lost too much blood.

Redneck said Ford’s last request was to see the sunlight as he died. “I laid him down with his head towards the door, so he could look out, see the sun, and I just held his hand. The last really intelligible thing he said was, ‘never let it be said that the bastards killed me.’”

Redneck said Ford had expressed a sentiment common among foreign fighters.

His most vivid memory of Ford was the tiny blue speaker he carried with him, on which he would constantly play the UK artist Artemas’ song, “I like the way you kiss me.” “He always was playing music and dancing around that speaker,” he said.

He said the likelihood of foreign volunteer fighters surviving on the front line depended on their level of experience but alsoon the tasks given by the brigades they joined. While some officers gave foreigners and Ukrainians equal tasks, he said, others “will sell you out and get you killed just as quick.”

He blamed the losses in his brigade on a “bad officer… who didn’t really see a difference between anyone. It was meat for the grinder, and he just sent whoever he could get.”

“At this point, you cannot say it’s not America’s fight,” he said. Critics of the war are “trying to say, ‘well, this is Ukraine’s problem. If we can just make peace now, we won’t have to deal with this.’ The truth is, it’s not going to stop,” Redneck added.

Redneck, speaking from the United States, said his unit was evacuated from the area and he later saw drone footage of Ford and Gunther’s bodies. The area where they fought is now under Russian control.

The process of retrieving the dead from the front lines is arduous and emotional. Former US Marine Corey Nawrocki, 41, from Pennsylvania, died fighting in Russia’s Bryansk region in October.

His body was paraded by Russian soldiers on Telegram, but after complex negotiations was one of nearly 800 dead returned to Ukraine by Russia on Friday, as was that of another missing American.

His mother, Sandy Nawrocki, wept as she described feeling a “whirlwind of emotions – relief, but sadness. A weight is lifted off my shoulder because now I don’t have to worry about what they might be doing to him over there.”

She described Nawrocki, a marine veteran of two decades with six tours in Iraq and two in Afghanistan, as a “smartass” who loved to make her laugh and was driven to fight in Ukraine because of the toll he had seen on civilians.

“Innocent people getting killed, babies being slaughtered,” she said. “I think that really bothered him.”

Sandy Nawrocki, pictured with her son Corey in an undated photo, says she was trolled on social media after sharing news of his death. Sandy Nawrocki

Nawrocki died after being shot while trying to help an injured colleague, his mother said she was told.

Images of his body and weapons were widely shared on Russian social media and she says her address and video of her home, were also posted. When she tried to notify Nawrocki’s Marine friends on social media of his death, pro-Russian trolls “would post all these nasty comments and, smiley faces,” she said.

She did not want her son to go to Ukraine but this “was an unprovoked war,” she said. “This is everyone’s war. If Russia wins, wins over Ukraine, that affects Poland, that affects all the European countries.”

CNN

The repatriation of dead Americans is the culmination of a complex and emotional path for those involved. Lauren Guillaume, an American living in Kyiv and working for the non-profit RT Weatherman Foundation, assists foreign families in finding their loved ones, often by trawling through morgues with the foundation’s Ukrainian investigator, Iryna Khoroshayeva.

Positive identification is possible through a combination of visual identification methods and DNA testing, Guillaume said.

Ukrainian officials said the task of identifying the dead is more complex when remains are returned from the Russian side. “After a body swap, we may be given a bag with 10 body remains belonging to different people,” said Artur Dobroserdov, Ukraine’s commissioner for missing persons under the Ministry of the Interior.

Dobroserdov confirmed that more than 20 Americans were missing in action, and said they could only release any part of the remains for repatriation once they had identified all of them, as they did not want families to bury part of a loved one only to be later given more remains.

One of the first cases in which Guillaume was able to assist was that of US Army veteran Cedric Hamm, from Texas, who was killed in the northern border region of Sumy in March. Hamm’s family were able to identify the unique mixture of Aztec and US military tattoos on his body in a video livestream Guillaume set up from the morgue. The body was then repatriated to San Antonio in December.

“I’m very proud of my son,” said his mother, Raquel Hamm, who said he had fought in Ukraine as he was keen to use his military past to travel. “His composure, even to the very end” had struck her, she said, describing how she was told “he saved another young man” during the gunfight that killed him.

“My expectation, honestly, was that my son was never going to be found,” said Hamm. “My son paid the ultimate price on the battlefield for Ukrainian freedom and that’s forever going to live with me. My child did not die in vain.”

“He was very selfless,” said a fellow American fighter injured in the battle that killed Cedric Hamm, speaking to CNN from the US where he is recovering. He asked to be referred to by a pseudonym, Mitchell, for security reasons.

Guillaume said foreigners can be declared dead through physical confirmation, like DNA testing on their remains, or through a court ruling, if there is significant evidence of their death. “It takes time,” she said. In March, her organization had a caseload of 16. It is now dealing with 88 dead or missing foreigners across 18 nationalities – half of them Americans. “Most of that is missing in action cases,” she said.

The true death toll among American volunteers in Ukraine remains unclear, Guillaume said.

She believes the rising number of dead and missing is down to foreigners being sent to tough, frontline areas where their prior military experience is needed. “We find that foreign operators do fill the gaps of very difficult, high-risk, high-reward operations. Their lives and their sacrifice are not wasted.”"

Tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians began returning home to northern Gaza on Monday, bracing for what awaits them in a region that has been reduced to rubble by months of brutal bombardment and fighting.

Israel opened a corridor into the north of the Gaza Strip on Monday, 48 hours later than initially planned. It blamed the delay on Hamas, saying the militant group breached the terms of the ceasefire agreement that guaranteed people would be able to return to the north.

Israel expected Hamas to free Arbel Yehud, a female civilian hostage, in the second round of hostage releases on Saturday. When it didn’t, Israel delayed the opening of the Netzarim corridor that bisects the strip, refusing to let people into northern Gaza. Hamas then agreed to release more hostages, including Yehud, on Thursday and Saturday, the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office said Sunday.

Israel said Yehud should have been released on Saturday as Hamas is obliged to release civilians first. The four hostages released over the weekend were all female members of the Israeli military.

More than 300,000 displaced Palestinians have returned to the northern Gaza Strip since Israel reopened the corridor, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza.

Seen from above, the crowds on Monday resembled a huge, slow moving wave making its way up Gaza’s coast, then turning inland. Most, including children, injured people and the elderly, were traveling on foot, carrying the little they have left on their backs. Most have spent many months exiled in makeshift refugee camps after Israeli forces ordered large-scale evacuations. They had been praying for this moment for months.

One woman told CNN her son was going to see his home – Gaza City – for the first time.

“He was born in Khan Younis. It’s an indescribable feeling that I am going back to Gaza City. It used to take us 10 minutes to get there, but this time it took a year and a half,” she said, adding that she would “kiss the walls and the ground” upon her return.

“May this be the end of the war, and may the ceasefire last… I gave birth in Khan Younis, and my husband is missing,” she said.

Many people have been waiting for weeks for this moment, spending the past few days sitting out in the streets or on the beach with their mattresses, belongings and water tanks, waiting for the checkpoint to open.

Eyad Al Masri, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, told CNN he was detained by Israel when fleeing the north and spent 75 days in Israeli prisons. He said one of his sons has been killed in the war and another one has been missing since February.

“I have no money or anything,” he said in Al-Mawasi, southern Gaza, while dismantling the tent his family has been living in. “I’m taking these four bags and going back to my house. I don’t know if it is still standing or not; I am going back to Beit Hanoun.”

Nadia Qassem, from Al-Shati Refugee Camp, told CNN, “we have been waiting for this day for so long.”

“We want to return home… Even though my house is destroyed. I miss my land and my place,” she said.

But the return home will likely be marked by more heartbreak.

“I’m going home, but I wish I weren’t,” Saadiya AbdulAl told CNN while traveling to north with an overflowing donkey cart. “My children are gone, and we are all devastated. None of my family members are left; they all became martyrs in Gaza City. Who do I go back to? I have no house and no one,” she said.

Gaza City, where most of the people making this journey on Monday had been living before the war, is among the most destroyed areas in the strip. There are no fully functioning hospitals or schools in the area and access to water, power and basic supplies is extremely limited, despite aid flows into Gaza increasing since the ceasefire came into effect.

The Israeli military said residents could return on foot along the Al Rasheed coastal road, while vehicle traffic can pass via the inland Salah al-Din road after inspection.

The Al Rasheed coastal road was damaged during the war and remains difficult to pass in some places. At some points, people visibly struggled to get through, with wheelchairs and strollers getting stuck in the deep sand.

Subhiyeh Mohammad was walking bent forward, dragging a small bundle made of a blanket through the dirt behind her. “Our children are gone, our husbands are gone, our homes are destroyed. I can’t carry much; I’m a dialysis patient. I only took what I sleep on,” the elderly woman told CNN.

Armed fighters from the Qassam Brigades, Hamas’ military wing, were seen among the civilians, wearing their distinct green headbands. Some of those walking past cheered, some posed for photos with the masked fighters.

“We will continue to firmly enforce the ceasefires in the north and south,” Defense Minister Israel Katz wrote in a post on X. “Anyone who violates the rules or threatens (the Israel Defense Forces) will bear the full cost.”

Hamas in a statement praised the return of the displaced as “a victory for our people, and a declaration of the failure and defeat of the occupation and its displacement plans.”

Israel’s far-right former national security minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, who quit in protest over the ceasefire and hostage release deal, claimed the return of Palestinians to northern Gaza was a “total surrender.”

Fragile truce threatened by tensions

Escalated tensions over Yehud’s release had threatened to derail the already fragile truce.

They heightened further on Saturday after President Donald Trump said he had discussed his plan to “clean out” Gaza with the king of Jordan and intended to raise the matter with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

The US president said he would like both Jordan and Egypt – which borders Gaza – to house hundreds of thousands of Palestinians either temporarily or “long term,” telling reporters onboard Air Force One, “because I’m looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now and it’s a mess, it’s a real mess.”

“It’s literally a demolition site right now,” Trump said of Gaza. “I’d rather get involved with some of the Arab nations and build housing in a different location where I think they could maybe live in peace for a change.”

Both Jordan and Egypt rejected Trump’s idea to shift Palestinians out of the enclave, saying such a move would displace Palestinians from their homeland. Trump’s comments were also strongly condemned by Palestinian leaders and human rights groups, who denounced the forced relocation of residents as ethnic cleansing and a possible war crime.

Trump’s comments appear to break with decades of US foreign policy, which has long emphasized a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine.

Dana Stroul, former assistant deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, told CNN that Trump’s proposal “feeds this narrative” that what Israel and the US really want “is not a Palestinian state living next to Israel, but actually to force them somewhere else.”

Specter of further mass displacement

Trump’s idea to ultimately move Gaza’s residents to another country has only raised fears of further mass displacement among Palestinians.

The Palestinian Presidency said the plan “constitutes a blatant violation of red lines Palestinian leadership have consistently warned about.”

“The Palestinian people will never abandon their lands or their Holy Sites, and will not allow the repetition of the Nakba of 1948 and Naksa 1967,” the presidency said.

The movement of Palestinian refugees out of Gaza would evoke painful memories of the mass displacement that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. There are some 5.9 million Palestinian refugees worldwide, most of them descendants of the 700,000 people who were expelled or fled their homes during the Nakba, or catastrophe.

Hundreds of thousands more were displaced during the 1967 war, when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and Gaza from Egypt.

There are fears that if carried out, Trump’s plan would bring an end to any future prospect of Palestinian-Israeli peace based on a two-state solution.

Hamas in a statement said it will “categorically reject any plans to deport and displace them from their land,” and called on the US administration to “stop these proposals.”

Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad also condemned Trump’s “reprehensible statements” and called the proposal “a continuation of the policy of denying the existence of the Palestinian people, their will and their rights.”

Human rights groups have also denounced the idea.

Human Rights Watch’s Israel and Palestine Director Omar Shakir said in a post on X that it “would amount to an alarming escalation in the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people and exponentially increase their suffering.”

US-based advocacy group the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR), said Trump’s idea was “delusional and dangerous nonsense.”"

Residents of the besieged city of Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, say they are gripped by fear as gunshots continue to ring out around their homes, days after rebel forces claimed they had taken over.

Several people, including foreign peacekeepers, have reportedly died and hundreds more are injured as fighting persists for a third day between fighters of the AFC/M23 rebel coalition and government forces battling to reclaim the city.

Hospitals treating the wounded are overwhelmed, aid agencies said, who also reported grievous crimes committed against civilians.

Jens Laerke, a spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian office said Tuesday that there are “many dead bodies” on the streets, adding that fighters have reportedly raped civilians.

Goma resident Camilie, who did not want to give his full name for security reasons, told CNN he heard sounds of bombings and gunfire, and found bullet casings in his backyard.

“People are hiding in their houses,” said Camille, who lives in Goma’s Himbi neighborhood. “People are scared because we have no electricity, water, or internet, so we spend the night in the dark.”

He added that several incidents of robberies and looting have also been witnessed in the area.

“Yesterday, there was a little bit of calm, and people thought that everything was over. Some people went out in the streets and were able to buy some stuff. And during the situation, a lot of robbing and looting took place… Many warehouses and stores have been looted by the local population.”

Rams Kiriza, who lives in the center of Goma, heard detonations on Wednesday morning, but “for the moment, the situation is calm,” he said.

Kiriza said that the rebels were yet to capture parts of the city but had ordered locals to evacuate.

The rebel alliance – accused by Congolese authorities of being bolstered by Rwanda – told CNN earlier this week that they had captured the city. Home to around 2 million people, Goma is the provincial capital of North Kivu and the largest city in Congo’s east.

Humanitarian and medical facilities have come under fire amid the fighting. Doctors Without Borders’ (MSF) emergency coordinator in North Kivu Virginie Napolitano said Wednesday that medical stocks had been looted and a bullet had pierced the roof of the operating theatre at the Kyeshero hospital as an operation was underway.

“The impact of this fighting on the civilian population is enormous. In addition to the wounded and dead, we are receiving devastating reports from internally displaced people camps where our teams can no longer go,” MSF’s head of programs in North Kivu Stephan Goetghebuer said, according to Wednesday’s press release.

The fighting in Goma is also stirring panic in nearby cities. From Bukavu, Congolese citizen Benjamin Lindani told CNN, “Everyone is trying to rush to get some money out from their banks and get some food from supermarkets,” describing long lines of people at banks and markets.

David Cikuru, who heads a civil society organization in Goma but recently moved out of the city to Bukavu, told CNN there were numerous government armed forces and pro-government militia fighters in Bukavu who had looted goods from some civilians. He said gunfire could also be heard on the outskirts of the city.

Rebels claim takeover

On Wednesday, Victor Tesongo, the AFC spokesman, told CNN: “The situation is very calm. We have taken control of the city despite some minor tensions from the government soldiers.”

Tesongo said that a stadium in Goma had been opened to receive surrendering government troops.

On Monday, the Uruguayan army, whose troops are part of the UN peacekeeping mission in Goma, said in a statement that “hundreds” of Congolese soldiers had laid down their weapons following M23’s 48-hour ultimatum.

Rwanda’s national broadcaster also shared footage of Congolese soldiers surrendering their arms to Rwandan forces at a Rwandan border post after fleeing Goma.

The Congolese government has not confirmed the rebels’ takeover but acknowledged their presence in Goma. Earlier on Wednesday, a new military governor was appointed for North Kivu, which was described by the Congolese military as being “under a state of siege.”

The army said that it remained “fully committed to restoring the authority of the State, neutralizing armed groups and ensuring the protection of the population.”

On Tuesday, the rebels gained control of Goma’s airport, blocking an ammunition shipment sent to the city by the Congolese army, a French intelligence source told CNN.

The violence also spiraled into the national capital, Kinshasa, where protesters lit fires outside several Western and African embassies, including that of Rwanda.

Calls for ceasefire

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington was “deeply troubled” by the violence in eastern Congo, which borders Rwanda.

During a call with Rwandan leader, Paul Kagame on Tuesday, Rubio urged warring parties to ensure “an immediate ceasefire” and “respect sovereign territorial integrity.”

Kagame described the conversation as “productive,” adding that it stressed “the need to ensure a ceasefire… and address the root causes of the conflict once and for all.”

The Congolese government accused Rwanda of equipping the M23 with both weapons and troops. Rwanda does not deny the allegations.

A spokesperson for the Rwandan government, Yolande Makolo, told CNN that her country “will do what is necessary to defend our borders and protect Rwandans.”

Eastern African leaders plan to convene an emergency meeting this week to find solutions to the crisis, Kenya’s President William Ruto said Monday, urging Kagame and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi “to heed the call for peace.”"

toggle caption Nathan Posner/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images

This week, as officials at World Health Organizations convene meetings discussing everything from Marburg virus in Tanzania to mpox in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there are some empty seats in the room — and fewer attendees at virtual meetings.

Officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are missing.

On Monday, public health officials at CDC were told to immediately stop communicating with the World Health Organization in a memo that was sent to division directors, their deputies and others by John Nkengasong, the deputy director for global health at CDC.

The order comes on the heels of President Trump's inauguration day announcement that he was starting the process of withdrawing from the WHO , a U.N. agency that the U.S. helped found in 1948. In Trump's executive order , he recalled all U.S. personnel who work at WHO. The order explained that the U.S. is leaving because of WHO's ""mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" unequal payments from member states and an ""inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.""

According to the official process for the U.S. to terminate membership, the country must give a one-year notice. However, this ban on communication takes effect immediately and does not allow for a transition period.



What the ban could mean

Officials inside the CDC and global health specialists outside of the organization are trying to understand the ramifications of this order both for the U.S. and for the world.

""This is unprecedented,"" says Javier Guzman , the director of global health policy at the Center for Global Development.

CDC collaborates with WHO on a wide range of health efforts, including the ongoing efforts to quash a major mpox outbreak in parts of Africa and an outbreak of Marburg virus , which is Ebola's cousin, in Tanzania. The U.S. has donated more than a million vaccines to these efforts and sent expert teams to support the local response.

Asked to comment on the future of these collaborative efforts, a spokesperson for WHO wrote in an email to NPR, ""we are analyzing developments and do not have further information at this time.""

""There are a lot of people who are looking forward to further clarification and direction from the incoming administration,"" said a CDC official, who asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press. They said they can't remember another presidential transition that included a directive similar to this. ""I am not aware of any sort of communication that's gone out to CDC employees like this one.""

Sponsor Message

A request for comment from CDC's media team was referred to the Health and Human Services media team, which has not responded.



How they've worked together

Among many other collaborations, the two agencies also work together on worldwide efforts to monitor and contain influenza. WHO runs the Global Influenza Surveillance Network. Josh Michaud , the associate director for global health policy at KFF, says that it may be challenging for the U.S. to develop flu vaccines each year tailored to the current strains of the virus that are circulating if scientists don't have access to the samples provided through the WHO system.

""There might be third parties which could create some communication channels and U.S. pharmaceutical companies on the private side could continue to have some kind of contact,"" he says. ""But it definitely throws a wrench a little bit in the works of what had been a system which is really important – not just for global health security, but for U.S. health as well.""

""It's absolutely vital that the CDC and WHO are talking to each other about what's happening. So a ban on that? I just can't see what benefit it has, but I see that it has a massive downside,"" say Dr. Chandy John , director of Indiana University School of Medicine's Ryan White Center for Infectious Diseases and Global Health.

Others agree. ""It's very hard for me to see any U.S. national interest that's being advanced here. And quite the contrary, I just think it's making it very hazardous for Americans,"" says Lawrence Gostin , professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of WHO's Center on Global Health Law.

For example, he says, WHO is convening an international meeting of experts who will discuss bird flu, among other things. Bird flu has been circulating widely in livestock and wildlife in the U.S. Without CDC representatives at the meeting, he says, CDC will be unable to examine the shared data from other countries where bird flu has been identified and understand how the virus is evolving and spreading across species. Gostin says this new clampdown on communications could hinder the country's ability to prevent humans from being infected as well as to develop medications and vaccines to combat bird flu.

Sponsor Message

""Not only is it reckless, but I think it's lawless,"" Gostin adds, explaining that even with the Trump administration's announcements, the U.S. is a party to the International Health Regulations and obliged to follow its guidelines. This is a legally-binding agreement managed by WHO that requires states to monitor health threats and report them to the WHO. However, there is not a strong enforcement mechanism for countries that don't comply.

""We criticize China relentlessly for failing to abide by [IHR] in rapid reporting and communicating of the Wuhan outbreak,"" says Gostin. ""Why we would want to be in the company of China or Russia, that violates these international global health norms, certainly beats me.""

Meta has agreed to pay President Donald Trump $25 million to settle a 2021 federal lawsuit alleging First Amendment violations and other claims following the company suspending him from Facebook and Instagram in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.

The payout resolves the suit Trump filed against Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg for allegedly engaging in ""impermissible censorship"" by removing the president from the social media platforms.

A Meta spokesman confirmed the settlement sum, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The company official said about $22 million of the settlement will be directed to Trump's presidential library.

The settlement amount was not revealed in a letter to the court written on Wednesday by Zuckerberg lawyer K. Winn Allen, who told a judge in Northern California that ""parties have reached an agreement"" in the case, saying that both sides will soon ask for the suit to be dismissed.

A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The payment represents a significant victory for Trump, and another step in Zuckerberg's efforts to court him.

Zuckerberg was among a number of Silicon Valley executives and companies who contributed $1 million to Trump's inaugural fund . Earlier this month, he ended Meta's fact-checking program, which had long been criticized by Trump supporters. And Zuckerberg promoted Joel Kaplan, a Republican lobbyist, to head the company's global affairs. In addition, Meta tapped Trump ally Dana White for the company's board of directors.

Zuckerberg's embrace of Trump comes after years of tension.

In a book Trump published before he was elected, he lamented the more than $400 million Zuckerberg donated in 2020 to support local election offices during the coronavirus pandemic. Trump then wrote he is watching Zuckerberg closely, threatening to throw the tech billionaire in prison for ""the rest of his life.""

Until recently, lawyers for Meta had been fighting the suit, which they said in court papers was baseless, since ""Meta and its CEOs are private parties"" and the First Amendment applies only to the government's censorship of speech.

Trump's suit claimed Meta only suspended Trump's accounts after being pressured to do so by elected officials, arguing that Meta was then acting at the behest of the government.

In response, Meta's legal team said Trump was suspended for violating policies against inciting violence, not because of any statement made by a member of Congress.

Meta's attorneys wrote in a legal submission that it made ""little sense to attribute a private party's action to the government based on a handful of statements from individual members of Congress."""

Public schools in New York are closed Wednesday to mark the start of the Lunar New Year.

It's the first time students in New York will have the day off for Lunar New Year since a new state law was signed in 2023. Last year, the holiday fell on a Saturday.

""For too long, our AAPI community had to celebrate after work or school,"" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. ""That's why we made it a school holiday – and this year marks the first time students will have it off!""

Hochul signed legislation declaring Asian Lunar New Year a statewide public school holiday in 2023, and lawmakers said at the time that it was the first state to do so.

On Wednesday, some of the state legislators who helped get the measure passed celebrated.

""Students across the state will be able to celebrate the holiday with their families without missing school,"" New York Assemblymember Grace Lee said in a post on Instagram. ""Passing this bill was deeply personal to me and I'm grateful to be able to celebrate with community members who fought to make it happen.""

On the lunisolar calendar, the Lunar New Year begins with the new moon closest to the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, according to National Geographic. The beginning of the new year generally falls between Jan. 21 and Feb. 20.

It's one of the most important holidays in several Asian cultures and is celebrated widely in countries such as China, Vietnam, Korea, Malaysia and among the Asian diaspora worldwide. This year is the Year of the Snake.

In the U.S., some local public school districts closed in honor of Lunar New Year include Philadelphia and San Francisco, while others such as Orange County are choosing to mark the occasion with in-school celebrations.

U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., who advocated for the school holiday when she was a member of the New York State Assembly, has introduced a bill to make Lunar New Year a federal holiday."

The Trump administration is revoking a Biden-era extension for Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for Venezuelans, a move that removes the work authorization for hundreds of thousands of immigrants and makes them eligible for deportation.

Kristi Noem, the new secretary of homeland security, announced the decision to end the 18-month extension of TPS for Venezuelans that Biden implemented days before he left the White House. ""The people of this country want these dirtbags out,"" she said on Fox and Friends. ""They want their communities to be safe.""

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has provided very little data on the immigrants arrested in recent days, specifically whether they have criminal records.

Numerous studies show that immigrants without legal status are less likely to commit crimes than non-immigrants.

TPS is a federal program that protects people from countries ravaged by war or natural disasters from deportation, and grants them work permits. It was created in the 1990's, to offer assistance to Salvadorans fleeing El Salvador's civil war. Currently, nearly a million people from 17 countries have TPS. According to the Department of Homeland Security, Venezuelans have received TPS due to ""the severe humanitarian emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic crises under the inhumane Maduro regime.""

Republicans have long argued that the TPS program has strayed from its original mission.

Secretary Noem added that, moving forward, the status of all migrants with TPS in the U.S. will be reconsidered.

The decision was criticized by advocates and Democratic leaders. Earlier Wednesday, Congressman Joaquin Castro, (D-Texas) told NPR , ""as a nation that thinks of ourselves as a beacon of light and hope and refuge for people who are fleeing dangerous leaders, this really is a betrayal of our values.""
