Many analysts view North Korean weapons moves as part of a strategy to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could result in aid and political concessionsThe official Korean Central News Agency reported that Kim visited the nuclear-material production base and the Nuclear Weapons InstituteIt didn’t say where those facilities are located but North Korean photos of Kim’s visit indicated that he likely visited a uranium-enrichment facility that he went to last September. That visit was North Korea’s first disclosure of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one to visiting American scholars in 2010During the latest visit Kim praised scientists and others for “producing weapons-grade nuclear materials and in strengthening the nuclear shield of the country.On Sunday North Korea said it tested a cruise missile system its third known weapons display this year and vowed “the toughest” response to what it called the escalation of US-South Korean military drillsNorth Korea views US military training with South Korea as invasion rehearsals though Washington and Seoul have repeatedly said their drills are defensive in nature. In recent years the United States and South Korea have expanded their military exercises in response to North Korea’s advancing nuclear programThe start of Trump’s second term raises prospects for the revival of diplomacy between the United States and North Korea as Trump met Kim three times during his first term. The Trump-Kim diplomacy in 2018-19 fell apart due to wrangling over US-led economic sanctions on North Korea. During a Fox News interview broadcast Thursday Trump called Kim “a smart guy” and “not a religious zealot.” Asked whether he will reach out to Kim again Trump replied “I will yeah.”

Many experts say Kim likely thinks he has greater bargaining power than in his earlier round of diplomacy with Trump because of his country’s enlarged nuclear arsenal and deepening military ties with Russia."

US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his proposal to “clean out” Gaza by removing Palestinians living there to Jordan and Egypt, a plan which has appalled some allies but has been quickly embraced by Israel’s far right.

Having first floated the idea Saturday, Trump warmed to his theme Monday, saying of Gaza’s population: “I’d like to get them living in an area where they can live without disruption and revolution and violence so much.”

He has not specified whether such emigration would be voluntary. The forcible displacement of civilians “can constitute a war crime and/or crime against humanity” depending on the context, according to the United Nations.

“I think you can get people living in areas that are a lot safer and maybe a lot better and maybe a lot more comfortable,” he said on Monday.

While there has been no response from the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, the idea was applauded by far-right Israeli politicians.

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who leads the Religious Zionism party, said Trump had recognized that Gaza was “a breeding ground for terror,” and “there is no doubt that in the long run, encouraging migration is the only solution that will bring peace and security to the residents of Israel and alleviate the suffering of Gaza’s Arab residents.”

Smotrich, who also has a ministerial position in the defense ministry, said he was working on a plan to implement Trump’s vision. “When he wants something, it happens,” he said. Smotrich has been advocating for what he calls “the voluntary emigration of Gaza Arabs to countries around the world” since 2023.

But the idea of displacement, voluntary or otherwise, is horrifying to Jordan and Egypt and likely alarming to other Arab allies of the US, threatening decades of international consensus about the right of Palestinians to a homeland. Ayman Safadi, Jordan’s foreign minister, said Sunday: “Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians.”

“Our rejection for the deportation is steadfast and unchanging.”

Trump said the removal of Palestinians might be temporary or “long-term,” but Arab critics allege that Palestinians have never been allowed by Israel to return to land once removed.

Neither Egypt nor Jordan would contemplate being party to a repeat of the Palestinian ‘Nakba’ or ‘catastrophe’ in 1948. Roughly 700,000 Palestinians were forced from their homes when the state of Israel was born. A second iteration would be tantamount to condoning and supporting ethnic cleansing.

Much like Denmark hopes Trump will abandon his ideas for US control of Greenland, the moderate Arab states will be praying that the US President forgets about transferring the Gazans.

The comparison was not lost on Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who said in an interview with Sky News Tuesday that “Palestine cannot be deleted and Palestinians cannot be expelled. My suggestion: Instead of Palestinians, try to expel Israelis to Greenland. Take them to Greenland so you can kill two birds (with) one stone.”

Saudi-UAE silence

Jordan and Egypt seem likely to huddle with their allies in the Gulf, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, in an effort to present a united front.

So far, the Saudis and Emiratis have remained publicly silent on the Trump plan. King Abdullah II of Jordan has also said nothing about his call with Trump on Saturday. But the Jordanian court pointedly released a read-out of his call Monday with new Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which may have been an effort at damage limitation.

The statement said they discussed ways to “enhance regional security and stability…and means to strengthen the strategic partnership between Jordan and the United States, as well as keenness to maintain coordination and consultation on various issues.”

The response from Cairo was more puzzling. A senior Egyptian official denied that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi had spoken with Trump, despite the latter’s assertion Monday that they had spoken. Trump declined to say directly if the Egyptian president had an opinion on taking additional Palestinian refugees.

“He’s in a very rough part of the world, to be honest, as they say, it’s a rough neighborhood, but I think he can do it,” Trump said.

The Egyptian official added that readouts between the Egyptian president and heads of state are released when they take place. The Egyptian Presidency itself has made no comment about any call and the White House hasn’t released a readout.

Trump also appears to have nodded towards the belief among some Israelis that Gaza isn’t really Palestinian land anyway.

“You know, when you look at the Gaza Strip, it’s been hell for so many years, and it just seems to be this – various civilizations start here, started thousands of years before,” he said Monday.

That fits right in with the perspective of people like the former Israeli Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir, who leads the Jewish Power party.

Trump’s remarks will also encourage the idea among some Israeli right-wing groups such as Nachala that Israel should establish settlements in Gaza. Daniella Weiss, who leads Nachala, told CNN last year: “No Arab, I’m speaking about more than two million Arabs. They will not stay there. We Jews will be in Gaza.”

Foreign aid as potential leverage

After a year of transformative upheaval in the Middle East, even the idea that millions of Palestinians might be moved from their homes is potentially a source of still greater instability. Sisi has previously said that taking in Gazans would threaten Egypt’s peace agreement with Israel because of the risk that some of them would resume fighting the Jewish state from within his country’s borders.

The risk is existential to Jordan, which has more than a million refugees from neighboring countries as well as about 2.4 million registered Palestinian refugees. Indeed, more than half of its inhabitants are of Palestinian descent, and its demography would be transformed by another influx. But Jordan cannot afford to dismiss Trump’s idea out of hand. A country of few resources, its 2023 budget deficit stood at 5.1% of its economic output, and a fifth of its workforce is unemployed. It is heavily reliant on foreign aid and is the second biggest recipient of US aid in the Middle East after Israel, with more than $1.7 billion delivered in 2023.

Trump has already moved to put foreign aid and tariffs at the center of a foreign policy whose first tenets have been more stick than carrot. That will not be lost on the Jordanian and Egyptian governments now in the crosshairs. Egypt is the region’s third-biggest recipient of US aid, with $1.5 billion delivered in 2023.

“I wish he would take some,” Trump said of Sisi on Monday, referring to Gazans. “We help them a lot, and I’m sure he can help us, he’s a friend of mine.”

Were Trump to persist with the idea, the prospect of extending the Abraham Accords to include normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia – a centerpiece of his Middle East policy – would also be jeopardized. While Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has close personal ties with Trump, he has repeatedly made clear that normalization is linked to a pathway to a Palestinian state. Emptying Gaza would not fit with that priority.

An Airbus plane belonging to South Korean carrier Air Busan caught fire on Tuesday at Gimhae International Airport in the country’s south while preparing for departure to Hong Kong, fire authorities said.

All 169 passengers and seven crew members were evacuated, with three having minor injuries, fire authorities in Busan said.

The fire service was alerted to the fire which began inside the plane just before 10:30 p.m., it said. South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said it began in the plane’s tail.

Footage aired by local broadcaster YTN shows evacuation slides deployed on both sides of the single-aisle plane, with emergency workers tackling smoke and flames from the jet.

Later footage from Yonhap news showed burned out holes along the length of the fuselage roof.

It is a month since the deadliest air disaster on South Korean soil when a Jeju Air plane coming from Bangkok crashed on Muan Airport’s runway as it made an emergency belly landing, killing all but two of the 181 people and crew members on board.

Budget airline Air Busan is part of South Korea’s Asiana Airlines, which in December was acquired by Korean Air.

Planemaker Airbus said it was aware of reports about the incident and was liaising with Air Busan.

Air Busan and Asiana did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Korean Air directed inquiries to Air Busan.

The plane is a 17-year-old Airbus A321ceo model with tail number HL7763, according to Aviation Safety Network, a respected database run by the Flight Safety Foundation."

The family home where rock band AC/DC was founded has been mistakenly demolished by a property developer in Australia.

Located in the Sydney suburb of Burwood, 4 Burleigh Street had long been a place visited by the band’s fans from around the world.

AC/DC’s Malcolm and Angus Young lived in the house as teenagers when they were founding the band, along with their brother George Young, a guitarist for another wildly popular rock group, the Easybeats.

The family migrated to Australia from Scotland, living first in a migrant hostel before moving to Burleigh Street in 1965.

When the Easybeats made it big, a mini riot once reportedly unfolded outside the house when a fan magazine disclosed the address. Hundreds of girls from local high schools descended upon the house and twenty forced their way inside – trampling a young Angus on their way, according to the home’s listing on Australia’s National Trust Register.

Burwood Council commissioned artist Claire Foxton to create a mural dedicated to Angus and Malcolm Young on the side of 12 Burleigh Street, just a few seconds' walk from the original Young family home. Andrew Worssam/Burwood Council

The one-story, two-bedroom brick house was bought by a property developer in March 2023 for 5.8 million Australian dollars ($3.6 million). It demolished the building last month, according to CNN affiliate Nine News.

The developer, Burwood Square, told Nine News that it didn’t know about the cultural importance of the home, despite conducting due diligence on the site.

“Unfortunately the historical connection to AC/DC was not identified, and we regret the previous long-term owner did not share this vital part of the property’s background with us,” said Leon Kamita, the company’s general manager.

“Learning about this connection after our plans were already underway has shocked us,” he said in a statement.

The developers plan to turn the lot into a 144 meter (472 foot) 50-story tower with 120 hotel rooms and 48 affordable housing apartments, according to Nine News.

The suburban home, a bungalow built in the “Federation style” that was mass produced in the early 20th century, had been in “poor condition” since the Young family left it in 1978, according to a review published by the Burwood Council.

In 1985, it became a brothel – with local newspapers promoting “Adult Work Opportunities” at the address, according to the council. It later served as a medical practice and was being rented out to an unspecified tenant at the time of the developer’s purchase.

An article published in the Sydney Morning Herald back in 2003 argued for the building to be protected from the hands of developers.

“There is however, one domicile begging for immediate acquisition and deification; a small, simple dwelling at 4 Burleigh Street,” wrote rock historian Glenn A. Baker.

Although the house was listed on the Australian National Trust Register in 2013, it did not receive historical protection to prevent its demolition.

Burwood Council conducted a review in 2015 to determine whether it should be listed as a heritage site. Ultimately, it did not recommend a heritage listing, citing among its reasons that the band’s “period of habitation was too brief to be relevant to the life and work of AC/DC.”

The review also said the home “does not meet the criteria for aesthetic significance,” nor did it have “any known technical or research value.”

In a statement sent to CNN, the council said “it has long-maintained that the Young House … has a special association with Australia’s rock music history as the site where band AC/DC formed.”

Despite not recommending the heritage listing, the council said it continues to undertake initiatives to celebrate the band’s legacy, including the commissioning of a mural near the site.

In its statement to Nine News, Burwood Square said it is “dedicated” to celebrating the location and is salvaging materials from the demolition to create a special space where fans can gather to celebrate the band’s legacy.

CNN has reached out to representatives of AC/DC for comment."

TEL AVIV, Israel — President Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who helped broker the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement, visited Gaza on Wednesday, hours before he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.

Witkoff's visit to Gaza was confirmed by a U.S. State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Israeli news organizations reported that the country's military took Witkoff to inspect the Netzarim Corridor, which it created during the war to split the Gaza Strip in two. It partially withdrew from the corridor in recent days, allowing tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to the territory's north.

Large swaths of Gaza have been destroyed since Israel launched an offensive in response to Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas-led militants who killed nearly 1,200 people in Israel and took another 251 hostage. Over 47,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since, according to Gaza health officials.

Sponsor Message

As part of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt, Hamas is scheduled to release 33 Israeli hostages, including eight who are believed to be dead, in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. Seven Israeli hostages have been released so far, as have nearly 300 Palestinian prisoners. More exchanges are scheduled to take place this week.

Witkoff's visit to Gaza is the first by a high-ranking U.S. official in more than a decade. Hamas has run Gaza since 2007. The U.S. designated it a terrorist organization a decade earlier. Witkoff's Israel visit comes after a trip to Saudi Arabia, and ahead of Netanyahu's expected travel to Washington next week to meet Trump.

The Trump administration is urging Israel to extend the ceasefire with Hamas. Netanyahu is under pressure from his far-right allies to return to fighting in Gaza.

Netanyahu's meeting with Trump next Tuesday would make him the first world leader to visit the White House since the U.S. president began his second term on Jan 20."

If the other paintings in the room that houses the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum in Paris could talk, they might be whispering ""good riddance!"" to one another right now.

That's owing to French President Emmanuel Macron's announcement on Tuesday that the world's most famous painting is to be removed from the Salle des Etats, its longstanding home, and rehoused in its own space in the Louvre with a dedicated entrance.

""This particular space, accessible independently from the rest of the museum, will allow 'The Mona Lisa' conditions of exhibition, presentation and interpretation [it] deserves,"" Macron said during the speech he gave standing in front of Leonardo da Vinci's early 16th century masterpiece.

The move, which Macron said is scheduled to take place within the next few years and aims to mitigate the Louvre's overcrowding problem, isn't just great for the Mona Lisa.

It could also allow the dozens of other artworks in the Salle des Etats — including masterworks of the Venetian Renaissance by the likes of Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese — to finally receive their due.

"" People have just been coming to check their 'I paid a visit to the Mona Lisa' box,"" said Souleymane Bachir Diagne, a professor of French and philosophy at Columbia University who was appointed by the museum in 2024 to give a series of lectures about its art collection. "" And even if you go to that room with the intention of looking at the other paintings, you would be distracted by the Mona Lisa.'""

The other major paintings in the space include Titian's Pastoral Concert, Tintoretto's sketch for The Coronation of the Virgin (Paradise), and The Wedding Feast at Cana by Veronese.

""The Wedding at Cana is one of the treasures of the Louvre. It was brought back from Venice by Bonaparte after the Revolution,"" said 2024 Louvre Writer in Residence Antoine Compagnon. Compagnon is a professor at the College de France and at Columbia University, and also a member of the Academie Francaise. ""It's a huge painting that people don't look at because it's on the wall that faces the Mona Lisa. They have their backs to it.""

Compagnon is also excited for visitors to be able to pay attention to his favorite painting in the room, Titian's Man with a Glove.

""There's a sort of melancholy that translates in the representation of this young man,"" Compagnon said. ""And the color of the glove, which is beige, attracts the eye of the viewer.""

Compagnon was present at the museum for Macron's speech Tuesday. He said he's glad Mona Lisa is being given a dedicated space. ""It will free the Salle des Etats,"" he said. But he added it remains to be seen whether all of these other masterpieces will remain in the Salle des Etats indefinitely after da Vinci's work is removed."

Public schools in New York are closed Wednesday to mark the start of the Lunar New Year.

It's the first time students in New York will have the day off for Lunar New Year since a new state law was signed in 2023. Last year, the holiday fell on a Saturday.

""For too long, our AAPI community had to celebrate after work or school,"" Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. ""That's why we made it a school holiday – and this year marks the first time students will have it off!""

Hochul signed legislation declaring Asian Lunar New Year a statewide public school holiday in 2023, and lawmakers said at the time that it was the first state to do so.

On Wednesday, some of the state legislators who helped get the measure passed celebrated.

""Students across the state will be able to celebrate the holiday with their families without missing school,"" New York Assemblymember Grace Lee said in a post on Instagram. ""Passing this bill was deeply personal to me and I'm grateful to be able to celebrate with community members who fought to make it happen.""

On the lunisolar calendar, the Lunar New Year begins with the new moon closest to the midpoint between the winter solstice and the spring equinox, according to National Geographic. The beginning of the new year generally falls between Jan. 21 and Feb. 20.

It's one of the most important holidays in several Asian cultures and is celebrated widely in countries such as China, Vietnam, Korea, Malaysia and among the Asian diaspora worldwide. This year is the Year of the Snake.

In the U.S., some local public school districts closed in honor of Lunar New Year include Philadelphia and San Francisco, while others such as Orange County are choosing to mark the occasion with in-school celebrations.

President Trump says he plans to use a migrant holding facility at the U.S. naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to house up to 30,000 criminal migrants deported from the United States.

In a White House memo , he ordered the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security to begin that process to ""halt the border invasion, dismantle criminal cartels and restore national sovereignty.""

The Trump administration said the deported migrants would not be held in the U.S. military prison at Guantánamo that now houses suspected foreign terrorists, including alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Instead, it said, they would be held in a separate area on the naval station portion of Guantánamo, which for decades has had a detention facility for migrants intercepted at sea, mostly Haitians, Cubans and Dominicans.

That facility has been largely empty for years, and Trump said he now wants to use it to house ""high-priority criminal aliens.""

The Trump administration broke the news Wednesday on Fox News, which had Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on the air sharing details about the plan.

Hegseth said migrants would not be held indefinitely -- as they are at Guantánamo's military prison, where some detainees have been for two decades without being charged. He said Guantánamo would be a ""waystation"" for them until the administration finds other countries to take them.

""This is not the camps. You're not putting criminals in camps where ISIS and other criminals [are],"" he said. ""This is a temporary transit … where we can plus-up thousands and tens of thousands, if necessary, to humanely move illegals out of our country, where they do not belong, back to the countries where they came from in a proper process.""

The Trump administration has not defined what length of time it considers ""temporary transit.""

It is unclear whether Guantánamo's current migrant holding facility has enough space for 30,000 people. When Trump first announced his plan, he said it did: ""We have 30,000 beds in Guantánamo to detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people,"" he said. ""Some of them are so bad we don't even trust the countries to hold them because we don't want them coming back so we're going to send them out to Guantánamo.""

But Trump later said he intends to ""expand"" the facility to ""full capacity.""

Vince Warren, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Rights, said he knows through reports from migrants who have been held at Guantánamo's detention facility that ""there haven't been 30,000 beds [there] in decades.""

""The facility is decrepit. It's been falling apart. It's in disrepair,"" Warren added, ""And, as a practical matter, the conditions that would be created if people went there would be so substandard that it would give people opportunities to file lawsuits around the conditions of their confinement while they're being deported.""

Warren acknowledged that the U.S. has the right to deport people with certain criminal convictions and that the Trump administration has widened the types of criminal convictions for which people are deportable.

But, Warren added, ""it does not give the United States the right to put them in a legal black hole in an offshore prison just to get them out of sight and out of mind. That's not something that human rights law would allow.""

Secretary Hegseth also said that a golf course on the naval base would have room for 6,000 deported migrants, so the Trump administration appears to be trying to identify different spaces at Guantánamo that could provide room for tens of thousands of people.

The administration did not say how much its plan might cost. But it would require construction; food and lodging for the people held there; guards or staff to oversee the facility; and transportation to get migrants there.

Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, said migrants would be flown there directly. Homeland Security Secretary Noem said Immigration and Customs Enforcement would run the facility. And she said Congress would appropriate money for all that.

The administration did not say when deportations of migrants to Guantánamo might begin."
