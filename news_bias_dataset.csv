We at Planet Money are constantly reading the work of economists and other social scientists to glean ideas, evidence and insights about the economy, and, more generally, the confusing world around us. Often this work provides the seeds for episodes or newsletters. But sometimes they're just interesting things we learned privately, and we don't do much with them.

Well, today, we're gonna try and change that. Welcome to the inaugural installment of the Planet Money Econ Roundup! Here are five recent papers that lit up our brains and are maybe worth taking a look at.

""Minimum Wages and Workplace Injuries""

by Michael Davies, R. Jisung Park, and Anna Stansbury

These economists analyze data from California worker compensation claims between 2000 and 2019, and they look to see if there is any effect of increasing the minimum wage on workplace injuries. They find one. And a rather large one. ""We find that a 10% increase in the minimum wage increases the injury rate by 11% in an occupation-metro area labor market which is fully exposed to the minimum wage increase."" That's right, when the minimum wage goes up, so do workplace injuries. Yikes. But why? Davies, Park, and Stansbury find that these workplace injuries reflect ""cumulative physical strain, suggesting that employers respond to minimum wage increases by intensifying the pace of work, which in turn increases injury risk."" This paper's findings are pretty shocking, and we will be looking down the road to see if other economists can replicate them. Link to paper

""Technological Disruption in the Labor Market""

by David J. Deming, Christopher Ong, and Lawrence H. Summers

Obviously, there is a big fear right now that artificial intelligence will kill a bunch of jobs. We don't know what's going to happen. But we can maybe learn from the past.

The three economists, one of whom is a former US Treasury Secretary (Larry Summers), go through history — all the way back to 1880 — and estimate how new technologies changed what people do for work. So, for example, how the invention of the automobile may have killed horse-and-buggy jobs and created jobs in factories manufacturing cars.

The economists find that one of the most disruptive periods for occupational change was between 1940 and 1970, ""when agricultural employment was still disappearing, manual labor was shifting into production and away from railroads, and clerical and administrative work were growing rapidly.""

One of their most interesting findings is that the least disruptive period was rather recently. ""The years spanning 1990 to 2017 were the most stable period in the history of the US labor market, going back nearly 150 years."" That's maybe surprising because that was an era when we saw the spread of the personal computer, the rise of the Internet, and the advent of the smartphone. The study suggests that, relative to earlier technological waves, these technologies didn't do as much to change what Americans do for a living.

However, since 2017, the economists find, we've started seeing an uptick in occupational change.

First, they find that high-paid employment has grown while low- and middle-paid employment has declined as a percentage of total workforce. Maybe good news?

Second, and related to the previous finding, the economists find that ""employment growth has stalled in low-paid service jobs.""

Third, they find a huge increase in people working in science, technology, engineering, and math-related jobs. ""The share of employment in STEM jobs has increased by more than 50 percent since 2010, fueled by growth in software and computer-related occupations,"" they write.

Finally, they find that ""retail sales employment has declined by 25 percent in the last decade, likely because of technological improvements in online retail."" They hypothesize that maybe this has to do with the advent of artificial intelligence. ""While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are too new for us yet to see any direct impact on the labor market, companies have been using predictive AI to optimize business operations since at least the mid-2010s. Online retailers like Amazon use AI to personalize prices and product recommendations and to manage inventory more efficiently, outcompeting big-box retail."" Of course, the pandemic had an effect here too.

Looking forward, the economists suggest that occupational change will likely continue at a relatively fast pace (compared to the 1990-2017 period) as Generative AI and other new technologies change the labor market. Link to paper

""Babies and the Macroeconomy""

by Claudia Goldin

Countries around the world have seen a jaw-dropping decline in fertility rates. In this paper, Claudia Goldin, the 2023 winner of the Nobel Prize in economic sciences, offers a new theory to help explain why (listen to The Indicator's conversation with her back in 2021). Goldin starts by providing a good summary of the economics literature on this subject, which points to reasons like the advent of birth control pills and contraceptives. Goldin adds another factor into the mix to explain why some countries have seen a more precipitous decline in birth rates and others have only seen slower declines: the speed of economic growth.

Goldin hypothesizes that countries that experienced rapid economic growth in the 1960s and 1970s — like Greece, Italy, Japan, Korea, Portugal, and Spain — saw bigger and faster declines in fertility because of the way rapid economic growth catapulted them into modernity and upset traditional gender roles. Basically, women go into the workforce, and that changes their desires to have lots of kids because now they're more focused on their careers. And that change especially creates conflict between the genders in societies that just previously were more agricultural and had old-fashioned gender roles.

""Rapid economic growth has given women greater freedoms,"" Goldin writes. ""But rapid economic change may lead to conflicts of various types when men are more swayed by traditions. What women require of men's time to raise a family and be members of a modern labor market may exceed the time their more tradition-bound spouses, or future spouses, are willing to offer. Household and caring tasks in such societies are largely women's responsibilities.""

Sponsor Message

In societies that experience more slow and steady economic growth, Goldin suggests, this change is less sudden and men and women can more slowly work out a deal where they share more of the child-rearing responsibilities. That may help keep the fertility rate from falling as much. Link to paper

""Gun Policy and the Steel Paradox: Evidence from Oregonians""

by Katie Bollman, Benjamin Hansen, Edward A. Rubin & Garrett O. Stanford

This group of economists look at how a ballot initiative in Oregon for more gun control affected demand for guns in the state. They find that the ballot initiative, Measure 114, led many Oregonians to buy guns and ammo like crazy. ""Background checks, a proxy for demand, rose 13.9% in anticipation of the referendum and surged 157% immediately following the election,"" the economists write. ""After judicial intervention halted the law's enactment, demand returned near pre-election levels."" The economists conclude that their study ""underscores the paradoxical effect of gun-control policies, offering a cautionary lesson to policymakers."" Link to paper

""The Gilded Age and Beyond: The Persistence of Elite Wealth in American History""

by Priti Kalsi and Zachary Ward

These economists look at wealth dynamics of the richest of the rich Americans during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They find that the richest of the rich tend to drop in wealth rankings, so they don't stay at the top. However, they do find a relationship between their wealth and the likelihood that their grandkids are in the top 1%. Having a ""rich grandparent exponentially increases the likelihood of reaching the top 1%. Still, over 90% of the grandchildren of top 1% wealth grandfathers did not achieve that level."" In other words, having super rich grandparents boosts the likelihood that you're super rich, but it's no guarantee. Link to paper

toggle caption Felipe Dana/AP

If President Trump tries to buy or annex Greenland, he could face a competing claim from an old ally: Britain.

That's according to Tom Høyem, 83, who served as Denmark's last minister for the autonomous territory of Greenland from 1982 to 1987, after which the position was discontinued. He has visited the island 46 times, wrote a book about it and says he considers Trump's interest ""very positive and very constructive"" for its defense.

Greenland is rich in rare earth minerals and uranium, and may prove strategic for global shipping routes, as Arctic ice melts with climate change. Even though Danish officials have said Greenland is not for sale, Trump keeps repeating his desire for it, telling reporters Saturday, ""I think we're going to have it.""

Høyem says Britain may actually have right of first refusal, based on diplomatic talks that happened more than a century ago, resulting in a 1917 treaty between the U.S. and Denmark. The British government was involved in those talks because of Greenland's proximity to Canada, which at the time was governed by Britain.

The treaty outlines a deal in which the U.S. purchased a cluster of Caribbean islands — now called the U.S. Virgin Islands — from Denmark for $25 million, in exchange for recognition of Danish sovereignty over Greenland. It was signed by then-President Woodrow Wilson and his secretary of state, Robert Lansing.

""I do not know why President Trump's civil servants have not shown him the document that his predecessor President Wilson signed — this official document — that says Greenland has been, and will always be, Danish,"" Høyem told NPR in a phone interview Monday from Germany, where he now lives.

The final text of the 1917 treaty makes no mention of any British role. But Høyem, who is an expert on Greenland's history, says British support for the treaty was contingent upon this point.

""The idea was that if Denmark ever got the stupid idea to sell Greenland, then United Kingdom had the first right to buy it or be consulted on its future — because of Canada,"" he says.

NPR has asked the British Library and U.K. National Archives for copies of any declassified diplomatic cables that might support Høyem's account, but has not yet heard back.

Another expert on the Arctic tells NPR she's never heard of any such British claim. It hasn't been part of any mainstream academic or diplomatic conversations, she says.

""We live in a world of rules-based order,"" says Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University. ""If we started opening up historical agreements on all former colonies of different countries, things would get pretty chaotic pretty quickly.""

""Russia could come to the U.S. and ask for Alaska back,"" she told NPR by phone from a conference in Norway.

As for British officials, no matter what their predecessors may or may not have said in the lead-up to this 1917 treaty, they are unlikely to get involved in any current discussions over Greenland's future. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has repeatedly downplayed Trump's claims.

In response to an NPR query, the U.K. Foreign Office wrote in an email Monday that it considers Greenland to be part of Denmark, and that its future status is a matter for the people and government of Greenland, and the kingdom of Denmark.

NPR also contacted the Danish prime minister's office, the Danish Foreign Ministry and the Greenland Committee in Denmark's Parliament for comment about Høyem's account — but has not yet heard back.

For its part, Greenland has asserted its right to self-determination, and most Greenlanders favor independence from Denmark. One recent poll with a small sample size showed a majority favor joining the United States.

But Høyem says many Greenlanders are ""irritated"" with Trump's talk of a takeover.

""It's a U.S. businessman's way of operating,"" he says. ""We are modern people now, and to use the words 'buy' and 'sell' — that's a ghost from the past."""

toggle caption Boom Supersonic

A private company aiming to build the first supersonic airliner since the Concorde retired more than two decades ago achieved its first sound-barrier-busting flight over California's Mojave desert on Tuesday.

Denver-based Boom Supersonic's XB-1 demonstrator plane, with Chief Test Pilot Tristan ""Geppetto"" Brandenburg at the controls, hit Mach 1.122, or 750 mph, at an altitude of about 35,000 feet. Brandenburg brought the plane to a successful landing at the end of the approximately 34-minute flight.

Founder and CEO Blake Scholl described the flight as ""phenomenal.""

""We're ready to scale up. We're ready to build the passenger supersonic jet that will pick up where Concorde left off and ultimately allow the rest of us to fly supersonic,"" Scholl said.

The Mach 1 milestone was reached on the 12th test flight of the XB-1. The company says it plans to incorporate what it learns from the XB-1 into a supersonic passenger jet known as Overture that can carry up to 80 passengers. The new passenger plane is designed to maintain a cruising speed of Mach 1.7, or roughly twice as fast as current commercial jet airliners.

According to Boom, United, American and Japan Airlines have all expressed interest in purchasing the Overture. In a statement emailed to NPR, United Airlines said that in 2021, it ""reached a conditional, non-binding purchase agreement"" with the company to buy 15 of the airliners, with ""options for up to an additional 35 aircraft.""

Boom says it expects Overture to be ready for commercial flights by 2030. The plane is expected to be capable of transoceanic flights at altitudes up to 60,000 feet — much higher than conventional jet airlines, ""high enough to see the curvature of the earth below,"" according to the company. ""Flying at supersonic speeds tends to be smoother than subsonic flight because at 60,000 feet, you're flying above most turbulence,"" it says.

Unlike Concorde, which proved uneconomical to operate, Boom says airlines should be able to make a profit selling seats on Overture at fares similar to those for first and business class seats on current commercial airliners.

""The biggest problem with Concorde was it was just simply too expensive to operate,"" Scholl said. ""So the single most important problem to solve is not to break the sound barrier, but to break the economic barrier.""

Concorde made its first operational flight from London to Washington, D.C., in 1976. Developed jointly by Britain and France, Concorde was operated for nearly three decades by Air France and British Airways.

However, the jet was criticized for its inefficiency. Compared to a Boeing 747, the delta-wing Concorde guzzled four times as much fuel and carried only one-fifth as many passengers — around 100. The plane was also the subject of complaints about noise from its loud turbojet engines and its sonic booms.

Scholl says Concorde had very loud, converted military engines, but Overture will be ""dramatically quieter, and that means around an airport, Overture will be no louder than the subsonic airplanes that are flying today.""

In 1996, Concorde set a speed record of just 2 hours, 52 minutes, and 59 seconds between New York and London. In 2000, a Concorde was involved in a fiery crash shortly after takeoff from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport that killed all 100 passengers and nine crew aboard France Air Flight 4590. The supersonic planes were grounded but eventually returned to service. Always a money-loser, the Concorde was eventually retired in 2003."

toggle caption Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images

President Trump issued an executive order late on Monday night to ban transgender troops from serving openly in the military.

The move was no surprise. Trump spoke frequently on the campaign trail about his plans. ""If you want to have a sex change or a social justice seminar, then you can do it somewhere else, but you're not going to do it in the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, Space Force, or the United States Marines — sorry,"" Trump said at an August rally in North Carolina.

The order speaks of transgender identity in sweeping and dismissive terms, labeling it ""radical gender ideology.""

Sponsor Message

""A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member,"" the order reads.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has 30 days to submit a plan to implement the order; until then many of the details, particularly how it will affect people currently serving, remain unclear.

This order harks back to a policy that started with a series of tweets from Trump in 2017 during his first term of office. The tweets surprised military brass at the time. The policy that was ultimately developed took effect in 2019 and grandfathered in service members who were already receiving gender-affirming care. It was essentially a ban for anyone trying to enlist as trans or who wanted to begin to transition medically while serving. President Joe Biden reversed the ban soon after he took office.

This order appears to go further than the policy from Trump's first term. It may result in trans people with years of service, including combat tours of duty, being booted out of the military and losing their retirement benefits.



How many people could be affected

An estimated 15,000 military personnel are transgender. That number is based on a survey of active duty military and an estimate of those in the reserves and National Guard.

The number of troops who will be affected by the ban is a portion of those overall numbers. According to the Defense Health Agency, which operates the Department of Defense's electronic health records, nearly 2,000 military personnel had a diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria"" as of 2021. That indicates they identify with a gender that's different from the sex they were assigned at birth.

One argument for why a ban is needed has been that it would be expensive to provide gender-affirming care to troops. ""The use of public monies for transgender surgeries […] should be ended,"" wrote Trump's former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller in Project 2025, a high-profile policy blueprint from the conservative Heritage Foundation.

Sponsor Message

The costs turn out to be very low. DHA's data showed that the military spent $15 million over five years on surgeries, hormones and psychotherapy for transgender personnel, or about $3 million per year. This cost was considered to be ""budget dust"" by military leadership, according to former Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus. (In contrast, the Department of Defense spent nearly $300 million on erectile dysfunction medications, including Viagra, for military beneficiaries including retirees between 2011 and 2015.)



Legal challenges begin immediately

The new order makes a very broad argument against gender identity.

""Expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service,"" the order reads. ""Beyond the hormonal and surgical medical interventions involved, adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.""

The first lawsuit against the executive order was filed on Tuesday on behalf of six active duty service members and two transgender people in the process of joining the military.

The text of the order is ""dripping with animus,"" says Sasha Buchert, a transgender veteran who is senior counsel with advocacy group Lambda Legal. ""It sets the stage for rabid discrimination."" Her organization has announced it will also sue the federal government soon.



Current trans service members brace themselves

U.S. Navy Cmdr. Emily Shilling did two tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan as a Navy pilot. She is now the president of SPARTA, an advocacy organization made up of transgender troops.

Shilling says after she transitioned several years ago, she passed a slew of medical and psychological tests to prove she was still fit to fly. She has since been promoted with merit. ""I'm a better leader now — as an authentic person bringing my entire self to work without that masking — than I ever was before,"" she told NPR earlier this month, speaking for herself and not on behalf of the U.S. Navy or the Department of Defense.

The cost of replacing trans service members will be substantial, Shilling argues.

""These service members are deployed around the world. We have service members deployed in combat units. We have aviators, we have doctors, we have people in every single branch of service and every subspecialty — we have Special Forces,"" she explains. ""When we all of a sudden have to pull these people out of those units, it's not like we can instantly recruit new people. It's not that we can instantly retrain people to put back into those units.""

Sponsor Message

Patricia King, a transgender Army veteran, says that in the weeks of waiting for the details of the policy to be worked out, active duty trans service members will be nervous.

""There are questions about who will be allowed to serve, for how long?"" she says. ""If you're a trans person who is allowed to stay, will you be allowed to be promoted? Will there be a potential for harassment? There's a lot of questions, and those unknowns create fear.""

She says even with that fear and uncertainty, transgender service members say that tomorrow they will get up for work, put on their uniforms, and do their jobs.
